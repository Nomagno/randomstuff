The Xueforce Trials:

The order of these 5 rounds will be random. Each round will have the same scoring.
The will be announced at least 5-10 minutes in advance, probably should be more for the race rouns.
For tracks, the following information is prepared:
MDH: Maximum distance for a single stint with soft tyres with the heavy kart including one lap of cliff
MDL: Maximum distance for a single stint with soft tyres with the light kart including one lap of cliff

TLH: How many laps the hard tyre lasts comfortable with medium kart
TTH: Average time over said stint
TLM: How many laps the medium tyre lasts comfortable with medium kart
TTM: Average time over said stint

TLS: How many laps the soft tyre lasts comfortable with medium kart
TTS: Average time over said stint

Type 1: Sprint
 - No tyre changes allowed (alloc of 0 0 0)
 - Randomized kart class that is forced on everyone (light/heavy/medium)
 - distance chosen will be any lap count between MDH*0.7 and MDL*1.3, rounded up, uniform distribution
 - Item boxes will be either on or off
 - [TODO: item policy randomization]
Type 2: Race
 - Either one compound at random is banned, or all are allowed [TODO: beyond a certain track length, the hard can not be banned]
 - Any combination of repetitions of the TLH/TLM/TLS lap counts, the corresponding allocation will be given [TODO: specify how much allocation can be randomized up or down]
 - Length has to target 28-35 minutes in length when calculated according to the TTH/TTM/TTS times their stint lengths
 - Tyre changes allowed (alloc as above)
 - Either one kart class is banned [TODO: randomly or by some criteria?], or all are allowed
 - Item boxes will be either on or off
 - [TODO: item policy randomization]
Type 3: Time Trial
 - No tyre changes allowed
 - Specific compound will be forced at random
 - No item boxes
 - One lap only
 - At random: free kart choice/one banned/two banned
 - Each player does one lap on a separate session. The fastest wins.
Type 4: Marathon
 - Race length 5-12 laps at random with uniform distribution
 - Forced kart choice.
 - Item policy: Nitro, items *and* bananas forbidden. One zipper per lap, all given at the start
 - Forced tyre choice of tyre 10 (no degradation).
 - Each player will be given a 5 second gap (by speed penalty to all the others) [unless the lap is too short or too long then blablablablayapyapyapyap]
 - 1/3rd of points are given according each to these laptimes: average, median and worst (ranking of each among all players)
 - No autofinish. Only laps after the first lap will be counted.
Type 5: Variety (can be battle, soccer, capture the flag, egg hunt...)
 - [TODO: randomization of the length for each possible mode]
 - It will never be the first nor the last round in the event.
 - Random forced venue from pre-selected list, forced choice of tyre 10 (no degradation). Must be different from the current track in all cases.
 - Free choice of kart
 - 0.5% step handicaps forced according to current championship standings, better standing = more handicap
 - If an individual ranking can be established, it works as usual.
 - If teams, the below is applied:
    Teams must be as balanced in terms of number of players. After that, the sum of points of each team's players' points must be as close as possible.
    Within each team, the players will be ranked according to their score in the gamemode (in soccer goals, in battle hits, etc.).
    Then, if there is a tie, the highest-ranked player in the championship so far has preference.
    Then, the rankings of each team are interleaved, such that the winning team's first player is 1st, the losing team's first player is second, etc.
    In case the result of the match itself was a tie, the team with the least total points gets preference for the interleaving.

Disambiguation is always by countback.

Team scoring example:

Scoring of all rounds: 80 40 20 10

Round 4. Socccer match
Blue team 3 - Red team 5
BLUE: nomagno 1 GOAL
BLUE: kimden 2 GOALS
RED: Cirno 4 GOALS
RED: Rowdy 1 GOAL

Blue team ranking: 1. kimden 2. nomagno
Red team ranking: 1. Cirno 2. Rowdy
Interleaved: 1. Cirno 2. kimden 3. Rowdy 4. nomagno
Points gain: Cirno +80, kimden +40, Rowdy +20, nomagno +10
